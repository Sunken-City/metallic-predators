Metallic Predators
==================

A simple card-based console game with LAN multiplayer.

I was tasked during my internship to create a project that abstracted the "brains" of the program from the view the user would see. This is the result of said assignment: a command line, text-based game. An experiment with events and event handling, as well as with networking. Multiplayer is actually a lot of fun, and you can play over LAN with friends! Single player is a bit lackluster, but granted, it wasn't the intention. In the future, I'd like to make a server using node.js to support worldwide play across the internet.
